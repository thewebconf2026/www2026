                Towards AI That Understands the Human World
              </div>

              <p>
                <b>Abstract</b>
                <br />
                AI has reached a turning point. Systems can now perceive,
                generate, and act in language and image across digital platforms
                at unprecedented scale. Yet as AI moves from tools to
                collaborators—embedded in decision-making, institutions, and
                everyday life—a new requirement becomes unavoidable: AI must
                understand the world the way humans inhabit it. This talk
                introduces Cognitive World Modeling as the next phase of AI
                development. It unifies physical world modeling—time, space,
                causality, action—with mental world modeling—goals, beliefs,
                intentions, emotions, and social norms—into a single, persistent
                representation of reality as experienced by humans. Together,
                these models allow AI systems not only to predict outcomes, but
                to reason about meaning, context, and consequence. Cognitive
                World Modeling moves AI beyond reactive toward systems that can
                plan, explain, adapt, and collaborate over time. Alignment and
                trust emerge not as post hoc constraints, but as properties of
                systems that maintain accurate, evolving models of both the
                external world and the humans within it.

                Building AI-Driven Web Experiences at Scale
              </div>

              <p>
                <b>Abstract</b>
                <br />
                AI is no longer just a component of Web systems; it is
                increasingly shaping the experiences users have online. From
                search and recommendation to conversational and generative
                interfaces, AI is redefining how people interact with content at
                Web scale. In this keynote, I reflect on how recent advances in
                AI, including deep learning and generative models, are reshaping
                the design space of Web technologies. Drawing on insights from
                developing AI-driven systems at Spotify, I discuss how search
                and recommendation are evolving into interactive, intent-aware
                experiences that support exploration and discovery. The talk
                highlights emerging system paradigms and research questions
                around building such experiences at scale, and reflects on the
                implications for the design of future Web systems and
                interactions.

              <div class="title">Data Degrades with Use</div>

              <p>
                <b>Abstract</b>
                <br />
                We often treat data as an infinitely reusable resource: a single
                dataset can support many analyses, train multiple models, and be
                shared widely without apparent cost. This talk argues that in
                important ways, data is not endlessly reusable. Instead, in
                certain contexts, data behaves like a consumable resource that
                degrades with use. The clearest example arises in the presence
                of privacy concerns. Fundamental results show that any
                informative public analysis of personal data inevitably leaks
                some information about the underlying individuals, and that
                these privacy losses accumulate across repeated uses of the same
                or overlapping datasets. If some level of privacy is to be
                preserved, this imposes intrinsic limits on how many times data
                can be used. In joint work under submission, we connect this
                perspective to the mosaic effect from legal scholarship, arguing
                that privacy risks arise not only from combining data pieces,
                but also from combining seemingly innocuous data uses. This view
                suggests regulatory and technical approaches that treat data use
                itself as a rival good. Data can also degrade with use even when
                privacy is not at stake. A line of work on adaptive data
                analysis shows that repeatedly querying the same dataset can
                lead to overfitting: results that appear valid on the dataset
                but fail to generalize to the underlying distribution, even when
                the dataset is very large. In both privacy and generalization,
                each interaction with a dataset consumes part of a limited
                resource, constraining future computations. Recognizing data
                degradation opens a range of research directions, including
                systems for tracking and budgeting data use, algorithmic
                techniques to mitigate degradation, the role of synthetic data
                and data curators, and new models of non-worst-case adaptive
                computation. Together, these directions work towards a data
                ecosystem that explicitly accounts for data degradation.

                (Everything You Never Knew You Needed To Know About),
                Rank-Biased Measurement For Web Search
              </div>

                <b>Abstract</b>
                <br />
                In information retrieval and web search we measure how good
                search engines are at ordering answers to user queries, how
                close two ranked lists are to each other, how good LLMs are at
                re-ranking sets of candidate documents, and how close generated
                answer sentences are to the ideal output. This talk begins by
                motivating the top-weighted measurements that arise when ordered
                sequences are involved, including reviewing the rank-biased
                precision and rank-biased overlap measurements proposed in 2008
                and 2010 respectively. The second part of the talk then presents
                recent work unifying the two previous rank-biased approaches as
                elements in a larger framework that exposes a third rank-biased
                measurement, rank-biased recall, a dual of rank-biased
                precision. Finally, in the third part of the talk, new ways in
                which the degree of top-weighting bias can be controlled are
                described, allowing practitioners and researchers to better
                define their measurement goals, and hence more precisely target
                their experiments.

                Professor Alistair Moffat is now in his 40th year as a faculty
                member at the University of Melbourne. Early work included
                coauthorship of the book “Managing Gigabytes: Compressing and
                Indexing Documents and Images” (1994, 1999), and development of
                innovative mechanisms for implementing ranked queries via
                compressed inverted indexes. Most recently Alistair has been
                focused on IR evaluation, including models for user query
                formulation and result perusal, and the material on rank-biased
                measurement that is the subject of this talk. Alistair was
                inducted into the SIGIR Academy in 2021, and recently became a
                Fellow of the ACM for his contributions to the implementation
                and evaluation of search systems.
