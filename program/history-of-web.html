        <h1>History of the Web</h1>
        <p>The History of the Web track highlights how key historical decisions, institutional incentives, and socio-technical shifts have shaped the Web’s evolution, and how those choices continue to influence the systems we build and rely on today. This year’s program traces a connected trajectory from early information retrieval and ranking, through the rise of user experience, engagement, and platform dynamics, to the Semantic Web’s vision of machine-understandable data and knowledge graphs. It then brings that historical arc into direct conversation with the current wave of large language models and agentic AI, showing how contemporary AI capabilities are deeply entangled with the Web as both infrastructure and archive: a source of training data, a medium for evaluation, and a space where social impact is felt. Across talks and the panel, the program emphasizes recurring ideas and persistent tensions, such as relevance versus reliability, openness versus governance, scale versus accountability, and shows how historical perspective can sharpen our understanding of what is genuinely new, what is cyclical, and what remains unresolved. Ultimately, the track positions history as an analytical lens for guiding more responsible, informed, and durable choices in future Web research and innovation.</p>

                Evolving Notions of Success on the Web: From Retrieval to Experience
              </div>

              <p>
                <b>Abstract</b>
                <br />
The early web was centered on documents, hyperlinks, and retrieval, emphasizing efficient access to relevant information. Over time, as the web expanded in scale and scope, its focus shifted toward users and their experiences, bringing attention, engagement, and satisfaction to the forefront. These changes marked a fundamental transformation in how the web is built and evaluated. This talk offers a historical perspective on how the web’s goals and success metrics evolved in response to content abundance, changing patterns of use, and rising user expectations. It explores how classical notions of relevance broadened to include intent, context, satisfaction, and trust, and how these evolving priorities shaped a wide range of online experiences. It concludes by reflecting on what this trajectory reveals about today’s attention-driven web and the emerging role of AI in shaping online experiences.

The Semantic Web’s Second Act: Why Everything Old is New Again in Agentic AI

                <b>Abstract</b>
                <br />
The Semantic Web promised a future where computers could understand data and act on our behalf. Today, Agentic AI is finally delivering on that promise. This talk bridges the gap between the history of the Semantic Web and the future of AI.  We will revisit the early milestones of machine-to-machine communication—from shared vocabularies and ontologies to knowledge graphs—and explore how the web’s original "logic layer" is finally being realized through modern AI.

              <div class="title">The Pendulum of Verbosity: The Evolution of Search from Blue Links to Agents</div>

              <p>
                <b>Abstract</b>
                <br />
This invited talk examines the evolution of information discovery and consumption on the Web. Over the past three decades, search has oscillated between verbosity and concision, both in how users express their needs and in how systems respond, revealing a persistent negotiation of cognitive effort and responsibility between humans and machines.
<br />
Before modern search engines, information discovery was mediated by librarians: users articulated verbose, nuanced information needs, and expert intermediaries pointed users to the right places in a catalog. Early Web search mirrored this model at scale: search engines primarily returned navigational results in the form of “ten blue links”, placing the burden of interpretation, synthesis, and decision-making squarely on the user.
<br />
Then came the era of efficiency. Search engines trained users to write telegraphic queries, which were invisibly augmented with exogenous signals such as personalization, location, and temporal context. Advances in large-scale information extraction enabled engines to move beyond indexing pages toward delivering concise answers “above the fold”, saving users clicks and reading time. Although these answers were often grounded in a single source, verticals such as symptom search pioneered multi-source synthesis through knowledge-powered machine learning models.
<br />
The most profound transformation has arrived with large language models. Search is increasingly transforming into conversational systems capable of synthesizing comprehensive, multi-faceted answers from disparate sources. Users are once again willing to write longer queries (now framed as prompts) and to consume much longer outputs. This marks a significant shift in cognitive responsibility as the search engine evolves from a mere indexer into an authoritative synthesizer.
<br />
We are now entering the era of agentic search. Moving beyond read-only operations, agents can plan and act on the user’s behalf, changing the state of the world and completing entire tasks rather than merely retrieving information. Yet this expanded agency raises the stakes: agents’ errors become costlier, and user effort does not disappear but instead shifts from cognitive effort (reading) to verification effort (auditing and supervising the agent). Viewed in retrospect, the history of search is not a linear march toward automation, but a continuous renegotiation of effort: from users adapting to engine constraints, to engines finally evolving to meet, and even anticipate, complex human intent.

From Lexical and Semantic to Predictive Search: Evolution or Involution?
              </div>

              <p>
                <b>Abstract</b>
                <br />
We cover the evolution of web search from lexical and semantic search to the generative AI-powered chatbots common today. For that we need to deep dive into the technical mechanics of vectors, neural IR, and RAG, retrieval augmented generation. To understand the impact of these new tools we need to look at bigger philosophical AI questions: What are we losing when we let machines “guess” for us? Are we widening the digital divide? Are we getting a little too lazy? And we will loss cognitive skills?
