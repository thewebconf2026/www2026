                <h2>The Web Conference</h2>
                <p>Since the invention of the World Wide Web in 1989, The Web Conference (formerly known as International World Wide Web Conference, abbreviated as WWW) is a yearly international academic conference on the topic of the future direction of the World Wide Web. This conference has been the premier venue to present and discuss progress in research, development, standards, and applications of the topics related to the Web.</p>
                <p>Over the past three decades, The Web Conference has been the forum where some of the most fundamental Web technologies have been introduced, such as the Anatomy of a Large Scale Web Search Engine in 1998 prefiguring Google, the EigenTrust algorithm in 2003 and the YAGO knowledge base in 2007 (see also the Test of Time Award past recipients). The conference assembles scholars, researchers, policymakers, practitioners, and end-users with one unifying goal: to envision and create the future of the Web.</p>
