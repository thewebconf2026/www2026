                <div class="workshop-meta">
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> 
                    
                        The emerging Web era of Artificial Intelligence (AI) presents a paradox: the same innovations that threaten security and truth also offer unprecedented solutions. AI technologies are becoming ever more interwoven in the fabric of online systems, presenting potential that can be used both for constructive and destructive purposes. In the post-truth era, generating persuasive yet deceptive content and automating social engineering attacks and the spread of disinformation has never been easier since the conception of the World Wide Web. At the same time, there exist exceptional opportunities for innovation and creating powerful tools to mitigate these threats, thanks to intrusion detection, threat modeling, and context-aware access control, etc. The AiOfAi workshop, which has had three prior editions at the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI), aims to highlight the double-edged nature of AI in the digital age, examining how it can be exploited to undermine trust, privacy, and integrity, while also serving as a foundation for more secure, ethical, and resilient digital ecosystems. We will discuss the societal impact of widespread adoption of AI tools, especially with the advent of Generative AI and its consequences, ranging from the erosion of public trust to the blurring privacy lines. AiOfAi will also address the ethical and legal frameworks needed to guide responsible AI deployment, which embodies fairness, transparent decision-making, and privacy preservation.  We aim to bring together researchers, practitioners, and enthusiasts interested in AI, cybersecurity, ethics, law, and human computer interaction to discuss methodologies, case studies, and tools that address the complex tradeoffs between AI capabilities and vulnerabilities. We welcome original contributions that present innovative ideas, proof of concepts, and use cases to tackle the challenges of the AI-powered Web.

                <div class="workshop-meta">
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong>
                        The ALTARS 2026 workshop explores recent advances and open challenges in Technology-Assisted Review (TAR) systems and their application to large-scale, high-recall retrieval across the Web. TAR systems, originally designed for domains such as legal discovery and systematic literature review, are now increasingly relevant in Web environments characterized by heterogeneous, dynamic, and multilingual information. As the Web continues to expand with both user-generated and AI-produced content, ensuring transparency, reliability, and fairness in automated review processes has become a central research challenge.
                        <br><br>
                        This workshop brings together researchers and practitioners from information retrieval, Web science, artificial intelligence, and data governance to discuss how TAR methodologies can support trustworthy and scalable information access. Topics include intelligent retrieval, human-in-the-loop learning, explainable and responsible AI, and the integration of large language models and knowledge graphs into review workflows. Through paper presentations, keynotes, and interactive sessions, ALTARS 2026 seeks to foster interdisciplinary collaboration and identify future directions for developing transparent, fair, and adaptive Web-scale review systems.

                <div class="workshop-title">4. 6th International Workshop on Computational Methods for Online Discourse Analysis (BeyondFacts’26)</div>
                
                <div class="workshop-meta">
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Expressing opinions and interacting with others on the Web has led to the production of an abundance of online discourse data, such as claims and viewpoints on controversial topics, their sources and contexts (events, entities). This data constitutes a valuable source of insights for studies into misinformation spread, bias reinforcement, echo chambers or political agenda setting. Computational methods, mostly from the field of NLP, have emerged that tackle a wide range of tasks in this context, including argument and opinion mining, claim detection, checkworthiness detection, stance detection or fact verification. However, computational models require robust definitions of classes and concepts under investigation. Thus, these computational tasks require a strong interdisciplinary and epistemological foundation, specifically with respect to the underlying definitions of key concepts such as claims, arguments, stances, check-worthiness or veracity. This requires a highly interdisciplinary approach combining expertise from fields such as communication studies, computational linguistics and computer science. As opposed to facts, claims are inherently more complex. Their interpretation strongly depends on the context and a variety of intentional or unintended meanings, where terminology and conceptual understandings strongly diverge across communities. From a computational perspective, in order to address this complexity, the synergy of multiple approaches, coming both from symbolic (knowledge representation) and statistical AI seem to be promising to tackle such challenges. This workshop aims at strengthening the relations between these communities, providing a forum for shared works on the modeling, extraction and analysis of discourse on the Web. It will address the need for a shared understanding and structured knowledge about discourse data in order to enable machine-interpretation, discoverability and reuse, in support of scientific or journalistic studies into the analysis of societal debates on the Web. Beyond research into information and knowledge extraction, data consolidation and modeling for knowledge graphs building, the workshop targets communities focusing on the analysis of online discourse, relying on methods from machine learning, natural language processing, large language models and Web data mining.</p>

                <div class="workshop-meta">
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> The rapid proliferation of digital technologies and the ascent of large language models (LLMs) and agent-based AI systems have fundamentally altered the information landscape, creating a dual-use paradigm where advanced tools facilitate both the detection and the sophisticated generation of harmful content. While these technologies offer significant benefits for automated fact-checking and claim verification, they simultaneously enable the scalable production of deepfakes, personalized propaganda, and multimodal misinformation across diverse languages and platforms. Current research efforts remain largely fragmented often restricted to specific platforms, monolingual contexts, or isolated issues such as hate speech or cyber-bullying, rendering traditional counter-measures like blocking or down-ranking increasingly ineffective against actors who seamlessly switch platforms to maintain reach. To address these evolving complexities, it is no longer sufficient to rely on historical assumptions regarding content propagation; rather, the community must adopt interdisciplinary frameworks that integrate novel agentic architectures for generation, retrieval, verification, and explanation. Our DHOW-MiLLA workshop aims to consolidate these disparate research directions under one umbrella, bridging the gap between academia and industry to develop robust, transparent, and adaptive systems for a safer Internet. By focusing on critical contemporary issues, including the impact of AI-generated content on elections and geopolitical conflicts, the workshop seeks to mobilize a cohesive research community. Through rich dialogue and knowledge exchange, this initiative strives to reorient the research agenda, fostering the development of cross-platform, multilingual solutions that not only mitigate emerging risks but actively harness AI capabilities to counteract the multifaceted nature of modern misinformation. </p>

                <div class="workshop-meta">
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> 
                        The Agentic Web is emerging as billions of AI agents discover, communicate, and coordinate across the open Web, marking a shift toward systems that no longer operate as isolated models but as Web-integrated entities. This workshop unifies architectures and standards with the foundations of interoperable ecosystems, convening researchers and practitioners to chart a shared agenda. We focus on web-native building blocks: agent registries and resolution, identity and credentials (DIDs/VCs), authorization (OAuth 2.0), discovery (DNS-SD), and federation patterns (e.g., ActivityPub), and their interfaces with application-level protocols (A2A, MCP, OpenAPI/REST/GraphQL/gRPC) and corresponding architectural models. Beyond wiring, we examine economic mechanisms (reputation under adversarial conditions, knowledge pricing, transaction protocols) and societal coordination (governance, accountability, evaluation at population scale). 
                        Topics include capability representation and matching, cross-protocol bridges, privacy and provenance, workflow orchestration, and reliable tool use over heterogeneous data and services spanning cloud, edge/IoT, and enterprise environments, as well as emerging patterns that let AI systems operate across distributed Web environments. These directions align with the emerging need to support function calling, tool use, and multi-agent coordination over heterogeneous Web resources, leveraging open and lightweight protocols to interact securely with distributed data and services. 
                        The program blends keynote, invited talks, papers, and a panel to surface design principles, pitfalls, and testbed practices. By aligning standards, infrastructure, and incentives, the workshop seeks to ensure the Agentic Web remains open, trustworthy, and sustainable.

                <div class="workshop-meta">
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong>
                        The recent growth of LLMs has expanded possibilities in data management, enabling powerful natural language access, reasoning, and decision support. However, reliability and trustworthiness remain major challenges when deploying LLMs in sensitive domains. Graph-based representations of knowledge and data (e.g., knowledge graphs and property graphs) provide a promising avenue to address these challenges. LLMs generate fluent responses but often struggle with factuality, bias, hallucinations, and a lack of explainability. Graphs, on the other hand, provide structured, interconnected representations that can serve as grounding and validation layers for LLM-based systems. Exploring the synergies between LLMs and graphs is critical to building data-driven applications where correctness and accountability are necessary.

                <div class="workshop-meta">
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Recommendation systems power much of the web economy, influencing how people discover products, content, and services. With the emergence of Large Language Models and autonomous agents, these systems are undergoing a major shift from traditional centralized pipelines to agentic ecosystems that can plan, reason, negotiate, and interact across the entire journey of discovery, personalization, and fulfillment. Large Language Models introduce new capabilities for multimodal reasoning, natural language grounding, and conversational personalization, enabling systems that adapt and respond with greater context and coherence. At the same time, multi agent systems create opportunities for richer collaboration among buyers, sellers, and platforms, while also raising important challenges in interpretability, robustness, governance, and evaluation. Conventional short term metrics such as clicks and conversions are no longer sufficient to measure coordination quality, long horizon impact, trust, or fairness across stakeholders. This workshop brings together researchers and practitioners in recommendation systems, multi agent learning, information retrieval, and mechanism design to explore principles for transparent, scalable, and responsible agent driven personalization. Through contributions on architectures, evaluation, trust, fairness, and real world deployments, the workshop aims to shape the next generation of adaptive, explainable, and societally aligned recommendation ecosystems. </p>

                    <p><strong>Description:</strong>
                        In an increasingly interconnected world, where information flows rapidly through various digital platforms, multimodal content analysis has become an immense challenge. The prevalence of memes or text-embedded images has further complicated this issue, as it is often widely shared due to its engaging and easily consumable nature. Whether humorous or thought-provoking, these content forms can quickly go viral, spreading across social networks and online communities with ease.
                        <br><br>
                        Their visual appeal, concise messaging, and emotional resonance make them powerful tools for communication—shaping opinions and driving online conversations. However, this ease of sharing creates an urgent need for effective moderation. Moderating multimodal content requires sophisticated techniques capable of processing and understanding both visual and textual information simultaneously.
                        <br><br>
                        The Fourth International Workshop on Multimodal Content Analysis for Social Good (MM4SG 2026) aims to address these challenges by bringing together researchers from natural language processing, machine learning, computational social science, and ethics to explore innovative solutions for content moderation. The workshop provides a platform to share cutting-edge research, exchange ideas, and foster collaborations toward robust multimodal content analysis techniques.

                        The recent achievements and availability of Large Language Models have paved the road to a new range of applications and use-cases. Pre-trained language models are now being involved at-scale across numerous fields, where they were previously unutilized. More specifically, the recent progress in generative models has paved the way to using them easily through textual instructions aka prompts. Unfortunately, the performances of these models are highly dependent on the exact phrasing used in prompts and therefore practitioners need to adopt fail-retry strategies.

                <div class="workshop-meta">
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> The exponential increase in scientific, technical, and legal data available on the Web, including research articles, patents, standards, and technical reports, has made their large-scale semantic processing, interlinking, and knowledge extraction a central challenge for the Web community. These data sources are heterogeneous, semi-structured, and domain-specific, containing complex elements such as text, tables, equations, and diagrams that make traditional data integration and analysis difficult. Yet, they hold immense potential for advancing knowledge discovery, open science, and evidence-based innovation. As the Web evolves into a vast ecosystem of human- and machine-generated content, there is a growing need to develop scalable AI models and semantic interoperable representations that transform this fragmented information into interconnected, machine-interpretable knowledge. In this context, the SemTech 2026 workshop focuses on methods that combine Semantic Web technologies, Natural Language Processing, Large Language Models (LLMs), and other AI technologies to model knowledge across scientific, technical, and legal domains. The workshop invites research on knowledge graph creation, semantic annotation, LLM–KG hybrid reasoning, and trustworthy AI pipelines that enhance the reliability, interpretability, and reuse of Web data. This is particularly timely as the Web community seeks robust approaches to integrate symbolic and sub-symbolic methods for managing and understanding the growing body of domain-specific knowledge on the Web.</p>

                <div class="workshop-title">16. The 16th Temporal Web Analytics Workshop (TempWeb)</div>
                <div class="workshop-meta">
                  <p><strong>Description:</strong> As in previous years, the objective of this workshop is to provide a venue for researchers of all domains (IE/IR, Web mining, etc.) where the temporal dimension opens an entirely new range of challenges and possibilities. The workshop's ambition is to keep shaping a community of interest on the research challenges and possibilities resulting from the introduction of the time dimension in Web analysis. The maturity of the Web, the emergence of large-scale repositories of Web material, makes this very timely and a growing number of research projects and services are emerging that have this focus in common. Having a dedicated workshop will help, we believe, to take a rich and cross-domain approach to this continuous research challenge with a strong focus on the temporal dimension. TempWeb focuses on investigating infrastructures, scalable methods, and innovative software for aggregating, querying, and analyzing heterogeneous data at Internet scale. Emphasis will be given to temporal data analysis along the time dimension for Web data that has been collected over extended time periods. A major challenge in this regard is the sheer size of the data it exposes and the ability to make sense of it in a useful and meaningful manner for its users. It is worth noting that this trend of using big data to make inferences is not specific to Web content analytics. A now-common strategy in post-genomic biology is to measure, quantitatively, the action of all (or as many as possible) of the genes at the level of the transcriptome, proteome, metabolome and phenotype, and to use computerized methods to infer gene function via various kinds of pattern recognition techniques. On the Web, to a large extent, we have also reached this point. Web scale data analytics therefore needs to develop infrastructures and extended analytical tools to make sense of these.</p>

                <div class="workshop-meta">
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong>
                        The rapid proliferation of foundation models has transformed how information is processed, generated, and consumed on the web. From large language models powering conversational agents to multimodal systems driving content recommendation and retrieval, these models increasingly shape user experiences and web intelligence. Yet, their reliance on massive, uncurated web data raises critical concerns about trustworthiness, including bias propagation, lack of transparency, and vulnerability to manipulation.
                        <br><br>
                        This workshop aims to advance the discussion on Trustworthy Foundation Models for the Web by introducing a causal perspective—a principled approach to understanding and improving the reliability, interpretability, and fairness of large-scale models. It will convene experts from machine learning, causal inference, web data mining, and social computing to exchange ideas, present recent advances, and identify open challenges. By bridging causal reasoning with web-scale foundation models, the workshop seeks to establish a roadmap toward more robust, transparent, and ethically aligned AI systems that operate responsibly within the web ecosystem.

                <div class="workshop-meta">
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong>
                        With the rapid proliferation of social media platforms, the web has become a vast repository of diverse multimodal data, including text, images, audio, and video. This rich data offers unprecedented opportunities for comprehensive analysis but also introduces significant challenges in data fusion, information alignment, and robust processing. Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have shown remarkable success in unimodal domains, yet their application to the complex and noisy nature of social media data necessitates significant innovation, particularly when such models are deployed on public-facing web platforms where performance, robustness, and safety are all critical. There is a growing need for trustworthy multimodal learning methods that can effectively integrate information from different modalities, maintain temporal, spatial, and semantic consistency, and reliably support downstream social media understanding tasks in real-world scenarios. 
                        <br>
                        The International Workshop on Trustworthy Multimodal Learning for Social Media Analysis (TML 2026) aims to bring together researchers, practitioners, and industry experts to discuss the latest advancements, challenges, and future directions in analyzing multimodal social media content using LMMs, as well as to rigorously evaluate their performance and safety for real-world deployment on web platforms. The workshop focuses on two critical and closely related frontiers: (1) multimodal social media content analysis with LMMs, including effective strategies for multimodal fusion and information alignment, and (2) performance and safety evaluation of LMMs, including the quality of generated content, instruction-following ability, model hallucinations, vulnerability to “jailbreak” attacks, and the generation of safe and appropriate content. By showcasing cutting-edge research and fostering discussion on these topics, TML 2026 seeks to shape future research directions in trustworthy multimodal learning for social media and to contribute to the development of more effective and safer multimodal AI systems for the web ecosystem. In addition to attracting high-quality research contributions, the workshop aims to build and mobilize an active community at the intersection of multimodal learning, social media analysis, and responsible AI.

                <div class="workshop-meta">
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong>
                        ZABAPAD (Zero-knowledge proof And Blockchain for WEB 4.0: Advancing the Post-quantum And Decentralized Era) is a workshop focusing on zero-knowledge technologies, blockchain infrastructure, and post-quantum readiness for the emerging Web 4.0 ecosystem. This half-day, single-track event emphasizes real-world deployments, empirical measurements, and interoperability across Web and non-Web domains. In particular, ZABAPAD explores the convergence of AIoT and ZKP—redefining identity and trust models beyond SIM in mobile networks, IP in Web 2.0, and NFT in Web 3.0. As AIoT systems evolve toward decentralized, post-quantum infrastructures, ZKP-based authentication and AIoT SIM functionalities are emerging as key enablers of secure, privacy-preserving, and verifiable connectivity among intelligent devices, vehicles, and edge services.
                        This theme extends to ZKML, Layer-2 proving/verification, TEE+ZK integration for verifiable compute, and post-quantum migration of identities, wallets, ledgers, and protocols. Expected outcomes include: (1) a practitioner-oriented adoption playbook, (2) an interoperability and standards checklist, (3) a curated set of reproducible benchmarks and datasets, and (4) a catalog of failure modes and mitigations for domains such as finance, mobility, healthcare, AIoT, public services, supply chain, and AI/ML. ZABAPAD complements the Web Conference and Web 4.0 communities by uniting global researchers and developers to chart actionable, trustworthy pathways toward the post-quantum, decentralized, and intelligent Internet.
