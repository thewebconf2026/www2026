                <strong>Description:</strong> Time plays a crucial role in how
                we retrieve, interpret, and reason over information. As
                knowledge on the Web continuously evolves, information retrieval
                (IR) and question answering (QA) systems must recognize not only
                what is relevant but also when it is valid. This tutorial
                provides a comprehensive overview of Temporal Information
                Retrieval (TIR) and Temporal Question Answering (TQA), two
                closely related fields that address temporal relevance,
                reasoning, and adaptation in information access. We trace the
                evolution of temporal methods from early rule-based and
                probabilistic approaches to modern transformer and large
                language model (LLM) architectures, highlighting how temporal
                modeling, reasoning, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
                are reshaping the field. Participants will learn the fundamental
                principles of temporal IR/QA, explore pre-LLM and neural
                methods, and examine recent advances in temporal RAG and
                temporal reasoning over evolving knowledge. The tutorial
                concludes with open challenges and future directions for
                building temporally robust and adaptive AI systems. By bridging
                classical IR concepts with modern LLM-based reasoning, this
                tutorial offers a timely and unified perspective on temporal
                information access for the evolving Web.

                <strong>Description:</strong> This tutorial aims to disseminate
                and promote recent research advancements in multi-modal
                generative AI, focusing on two dominant families of techniques:
                multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) for understanding and
                diffusion models for visual generation. We will provide a
                systematic discussion of MLLMs and diffusion models, covering
                their probabilistic modeling methods, architectures, and
                multi-modal interaction mechanisms. In dynamic and open
                environments, shifting data distributions, emerging concepts,
                and evolving complex application scenarios create significant
                obstacles for multi-modal generative models. This tutorial
                explores solutions and future directions to address these
                challenges from two aspects: one is generalizable post-training
                techniques to adapt multi-modal generative models to new
                concepts, and the other is the unified multi-modal generation
                and understanding framework for complex multi-modal tasks.

                <strong>Description:</strong> Fairness is a crucial aspect of a
                responsible Web, as systematic algorithms may discriminate
                against certain groups and harm the overall web ecosystem. To
                address this issue, numerous fairness-aware information
                retrieval (IR) models and evaluation metrics have been proposed.
                However, the inherent complexity of both fairness and IR systems
                makes it difficult to systematically summarize the progress
                achieved so far. This complexity calls for a more structured and
                novel perspective to re-examine and guide future directions in
                fairness-aware IR research. The field of economics has a long
                history of studying fairness, providing a rich theoretical and
                empirical foundation. Similarly, the Web ecosystem can be viewed
                as a specialized economic market, where a system-oriented
                perspective enables the integration of IR fairness into a
                broader and more structured framework. In this tutorial, we
                begin by drawing parallels between the components of IR systems
                and those of economic markets, illustrating how IR systems can
                be understood as a form of economic system. Next, we organize
                fairness algorithms within an economic cube, where each
                dimension represents a distinct fairness taxonomy: macro vs.
                micro, demand vs. supply, and short-term vs. long-term. Finally,
                we demonstrate how this economic framework can be applied to
                most fairness algorithms and a variety of real-world IR
                applications. Unlike previous fairness-aware tutorials, our
                tutorial not only offers a clear and novel perspective on
                fairness but also encourages the use of economic tools to
                address fairness challenges. We hope it provides a fresh and
                comprehensive outlook on building a responsible Web, while
                highlighting open problems and promising directions for future
                research.

                <strong>Description:</strong> This hands-on tutorial provides
                researchers with practical tools and frameworks for TikTok data
                collection for Computational Social Science. Recent work
                systematically testing three TikTok data collection techniques
                (currently under review at the Web Conference) reveals TikTok
                data collection method dramatically alters research results.
                Participants in our tutorial will learn how to use web-scraping
                data collection methods (Pyktok and Apify) as well as the
                official TikTok Research API. This tutorial will explore best
                practices for data collection from three endpoints—Users,
                Hashtags, and Comments—using strategies identified through
                stress testing that: 1) reduce algorithmic selection bias in
                data collection; 2) substitute or fill missing data by combining
                multiple tools for a more complete dataset; 3) improve
                collection efficiency by balancing resources and dataset size
                (including API recommendations such as stratified sampling and
                use of the is_random and has_more hyperparameter, and
                web-scraping strategies for optimal time windows to minimize
                resource waste). Lastly, we introduce a checklist for reporting
                data collection procedures and results to increase the
                transparency, replicability, and generalizability of TikTok
                research. By engaging in this tutorial, researchers will be
                equipped with actionable methods to obtain high-quality TikTok
                datasets and decision-making criteria for optimizing collection
                settings and parameters to answer their research questions with
                consideration to available resources.

                <strong>Description:</strong> This tutorial explores the next
                generation of AI-powered software development, where large
                language models (LLMs) function as collaborative agents that
                plan, code, test, and review alongside human developers. Using
                GitHub Copilot, Mistral Code and Kiro as running exemplars, we
                synthesize the latest advances in multi-agent coordination,
                reflective collaboration, long-term memory and context
                maintenance, and tool-integrated verification. We show how
                role-specialized agent teams, manager–tool routing, and
                spec-driven development are replacing single-model code
                completion with structured, repeatable workflows that close the
                loop from generation to assurance, while addressing critical
                concerns around evaluation rigor, security guardrails, and safe
                deployment. Attendees will leave with a practical blueprint for
                designing and evaluating collaborative coding agents in real
                engineering environments. The tutorial blends concepts and live
                demonstrations, covering task decomposition, memory and
                retrieval, autonomous debugging with runtime feedback, and
                seamless integration into IDEs, version control, and CI/CD
                pipelines. We distill proven "do and don't" patterns for
                reliability, security, cost, and scalability, and map open
                research challenges to concrete experimental setups and metrics.
                The result is a concise, research-ready guide for building
                agentic systems that deliver measurable productivity and quality
                gains in modern software development.

                <strong>Description:</strong> Spatio-temporal (ST) data,
                including geo-social media check-ins, location-based services
                (LBS), and transportation records, offers unprecedented
                opportunities for analyzing human mobility and urban dynamics.
                The emergence of Foundation Models and Large Language Models
                (LLMs) has initiated a profound paradigm shift in this field,
                moving from traditional, task-specific deep learning toward
                universal, generalizable intelligence. This lecture-style
                tutorial provides a timely and comprehensive overview of
                LLM-Enhanced Web-Centric Spatio-Temporal Intelligence,
                systematically presenting the methods, applications, and
                frontier research in the LLM era. Our tutorial is innovatively
                organized according to three levels of ST analysis:
                Location-level intelligence focuses on examining spatial
                activities within specific geographic locations. Region-level
                intelligence broadens the scope to include large-scale spatial
                patterns and flows across regions. The tutorial aims to provide
                the participants with a comprehensive roadmap of the current
                state and future potential of applying LLMs and FMs to
                Web-centric spatio-temporal data, making it an invaluable
                resource for this evolving field.

                <strong>Description:</strong> The 2025 Nobel Prize in Physics
                recognized groundbreaking advances in quantum information
                science, underscoring the transformative potential of quantum
                technologies for computation and communication. As these
                developments accelerate, they simultaneously pose profound
                challenges to classical cryptographic foundations—particularly
                the public-key algorithms securing blockchain systems, digital
                signatures, and distributed consensus. However, despite the
                clear urgency to address quantum-induced vulnerabilities, the
                translation of theoretical quantum computing breakthroughs from
                laboratory research into robust, real-world applications for
                blockchain security remains limited. Building on this momentum,
                our tutorial explores how quantum computing and blockchain can
                jointly redefine the trust, efficiency, and intelligence of
                next-generation Web systems. We introduce the principles of
                quantum computing and their implications for secure, scalable
                blockchain architectures, emphasizing post-quantum and
                quantum-assisted cryptography. The tutorial situates these
                technologies within broader contexts of privacy, human–computer
                interaction, and ethical data governance, highlighting how
                interdisciplinary collaboration across computer science,
                economics, and human-centered computing can enable a more
                trustworthy Web. We further discuss how quantum techniques can
                enhance computational efficiency, randomness, and resilience for
                decentralized systems, while open data standards provide a
                foundation for transparency, interoperability, and

                <strong>Description:</strong> Conversational search enables
                multi-turn interactions between users and systems to fulfill
                users' complex information needs. During this interaction, the
                system should understand the users' search intent within the
                conversational context and then return the relevant information
                through a flexible, dialogue-based interface. Large language
                models (LLMs) with capacities of instruction following, content
                generation, and reasoning, attract significant attention and
                advancements, providing new opportunities and challenges for
                building up conversational search systems. More recently, LLMs
                have begun to drive search systems towards agentic paradigms,
                acting as autonomous entities that can plan strategies, execute
                dynamic retrieval, and support a wide range of autonomous
                behaviours. This tutorial aims to connect fundamentals with
                recent agentic paradigms in conversational search. It is
                designed for students, researchers, and practitioners from both
                academia and industry. Participants will gain a comprehensive
                understanding of both the fundamental principles and the latest
                developments enabled by LLMs, equipping them with the knowledge
                to contribute to the next generation of conversational search
                systems.

                <strong>Description:</strong> Team recommendation involves
                selecting skilled experts to form an almost surely successful
                collaborative team, or refining the team composition to maintain
                and/or excel at performance. To address the tedious and
                error-prone manual process, various computational approaches
                have been proposed, especially for the web-scale social networks
                and widespread online collaboration and diversity of
                interactions. In this tutorial, with a brief overview of
                pioneering subgraph optimization approaches and their
                shortfalls, we deliberately focus on the recent learning-based
                approaches, with a particular in-depth exploration of graph
                neural network-based methods. More importantly, and for the
                first of its kind, we then discuss team refinement, which
                involves structural adjustments or expert replacements to
                enhance team performance in dynamic environments. Finally, we
                discuss training strategies, benchmarking datasets, and
                open-source libraries, along with future research directions and
                real-world applications. Further resources are at

                <strong>Description:</strong> This tutorial offers a
                comprehensive guide on using multiarmed bandit (MAB) algorithms
                to improve Large Language Models (LLMs), with a special focus on
                enabling agentic behavior—where LLMs act with autonomy, make
                decisions, and adapt based on feedback. As Natural Language
                Processing (NLP) tasks grow, efficient, adaptive, and agentic
                language generation systems are increasingly needed. MAB
                algorithms, which balance exploration and exploitation under
                uncertainty, are especially promising for enhancing the
                decision-making capabilities of such systems. The tutorial
                covers foundational MAB concepts, including the
                exploration-exploitation trade-off and strategies like
                epsilon-greedy, UCB (Upper Confidence Bound), and Thompson
                Sampling. It then explores integrating MAB with LLMs, focusing
                on designing architectures that treat text generation options as
                arms in a bandit problem. Practical aspects like reward design,
                exploration policies, scalability, and the emergence of agentic
                traits in LLMs are discussed. Real-world case studies
                demonstrate the benefits of MAB-augmented, agentic LLMs in
                content recommendation, dialogue generation, and personalized
                content creation, showing how these techniques improve
                relevance, diversity, and user engagement.

                <strong>Description:</strong> The Web is overflowing with
                unstructured content, ranging from scientific papers, enterprise
                documents to social media posts. Unlocking the knowledge hidden
                in these sources is critical for next-generation Web
                intelligence, enabling semantic search, advanced reasoning, and
                deep collaboration with Large Language Models (LLMs). This
                tutorial presents a comprehensive overview of methods for
                transforming unstructured Web content into structured Knowledge
                Graphs (KGs), addressing key challenges in information
                extraction across multiple dimensions, including entities and
                relations, events, spatio-temporal indices, visual layouts, and
                metadata. We then discuss methods for constructing and curating
                high-quality, multi-perspective KGs at scale. Participants will
                gain a systematic understanding of state-of-the-art methods,
                including recent advances in document analysis, document-to-KG
                approaches, and hybrid systems combining LLMs with structured
                knowledge, such as LLM-driven knowledge graph construction from
                unstructured documents, RAG over enterprise knowledge bases,
                KG-augmented LLMs for grounded reasoning, and neuro-symbolic
                reasoning pipelines. We will cover the paradigm shift of
                knowledge graph construction from supervised deep learning
                models to LLM-assisted knowledge engineering while highlighting
                open challenges such as scalability, factual consistency, and
                evaluation. We will demonstrate KG's transformative potential
                through practical applications in web search, question
                answering, causal reasoning and scientific discovery.

                <strong>Description:</strong> The agentic web—where billions of
                autonomous AI agents discover, communicate, and coordinate
                across organizational boundaries—requires new foundations
                spanning technical infrastructure, economic mechanisms, and
                societal coordination. Just as DNS and HTTP shaped the
                traditional web's evolution, the architectural decisions we make
                today for agent registries, protocols, and reputation systems
                will determine what forms of distributed intelligence emerge
                tomorrow. This lecture-style tutorial provides a comprehensive
                framework for understanding the agentic web across three
                development phases: Foundations (discovery, identity,
                protocols), Agentic Economy (pricing, reputation, markets), and
                Agentic Society (population dynamics, governance, coordination).
                Drawing on recent advances in registry architectures, protocol
                standards, and resolution mechanisms, this tutorial equips
                participants with conceptual frameworks and practical insights
                for designing infrastructure that enables safe, scalable, and
                sustainable agent ecosystems. The tutorial emphasizes

                <strong>Description:</strong> Structured data constitutes one of
                the most ubiquitous data modalities in web-scale and enterprise
                applications, supporting tasks such as recommendation,
                forecasting, and user behavior analysis. Conventional modeling
                paradigms—ranging from generalized linear models and gradient
                boosting to deep structured networks—have provided strong
                baselines for predictive analytics and decision support.
                However, the recent emergence of foundation models and
                in-context learning (ICL) has sparked a new paradigm for
                structured modeling, moving from dataset-specific training
                toward universal, adaptable inference. Emerging structured
                foundation models illustrate how large-scale pretraining,
                synthetic data generation, and ICL-based inference can extend
                foundation-model principles to structured data. These
                developments open new possibilities for multi-task learning,
                zero-shot inference, and knowledge transfer across diverse
                structured settings. Yet, the space of structured foundation
                models remains largely unexplored, with open questions
                surrounding data generation, multi-task setting, pretraining
                objectives, and evaluation standards. This tutorial will provide
                a structured overview of both conventional modeling and recent
                ICL-based approaches. Participants will gain a comprehensive
                understanding of established methods, current advances in
                foundation models, and open research challenges. In particular,
                we will offer an in-depth introduction to structured ICL and
                review the most representative foundation models in this field.
                Several key topics in this field will be discussed, including
                pretraining data generation, multi-task learning, and other
                emerging directions in the modeling of structured data. This
                tutorial aims to bridge conventional machine learning and the
                emerging foundation-model paradigm, providing attendees with
                conceptual and practical insights into structured data modeling
                in the era of generalist foundation models.

                <strong>Description:</strong> Graph learning is transforming web
                intelligence, powering applications from recommender systems to
                anomaly detection. However, most existing approaches implicitly
                assume ideal conditions where training and testing data are
                accurate, complete, and free from manipulation. In reality, web
                environments rarely exhibit such stability. Dynamic user
                behavior, incomplete or outdated content, adversarial
                interference, and sudden distribution shifts can all erode the
                reliability of even state-of-the-art models, leading to biased
                or unsafe outcomes. This tutorial provides a comprehensive
                survey of emerging strategies for robust graph learning on the
                web. We first present a structured taxonomy of the principal
                robustness threats specific to web contexts. Next, we categorize
                current robust graph learning approaches, spanning data-level
                preprocessing to model-level adaptation and generalization, and
                discuss representative techniques in detail. We then showcase
                real-world case studies illustrating how robustness challenges
                emerge and how targeted methods can mitigate them in the web
                system. By integrating theoretical foundations with practical
                web applications, this tutorial offers researchers, engineers,
                and platform developers actionable strategies to safeguard
                graph-based AI in dynamic, high-impact online environments. The

                practitioners who want AI output to stand up to real-world Web
                constraints. In a browser-only setting with ChatGPT (free tier),
                it teaches a clear, repeatable workflow for three common tasks:
                PII-safe summarization, meta-/FAQ generation for researcher
                profiles, and moderation of user-generated content (UGC).
                Coverage includes the core prompting techniques from the deck:
                zero-shot vs. few-shot, chain-of-thought (hidden reasoning),
                role prompts, output formatting and constraint setting,
                multi-turn prompt chaining, proactive clarification, and reverse
                prompting. Participants begin with baseline prompts, add
                guardrails, and run a mini-evaluation with a small gold set and
                red-team probes, emphasizing privacy and consent, logging
                minimization, accessibility, and publish or no-publish
                thresholds so outputs are deployable and defensible. To
                illustrate tool-augmented prompting, the session includes
                publishing an n8n endpoint and, where available, demonstrating
                invocation from ChatGPT Developer Mode or MCP to produce
                grounded cited answers. The use of the deep research mode and

                <strong>Description:</strong> This tutorial aims to enlighten
                the ties between human heuristics and AI harms in today's mixed
                human-AI decision making. A bowtie model and an AI
                sociotechnical harms taxonomy will explore the role of cognitive
                science principles as causes of AI harms and consequences,
                particularly in the context of the Web. Attendees will be
                encouraged to recognize risk events which challenge responsible
                human and AI preferences and will gain a deeper understanding of
                emerging practices through real world examples of varying risk
                levels, such as in justice, job hiring, financial lending, and
                health decision making domains.
