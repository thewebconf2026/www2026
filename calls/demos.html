        <h1>Call for Demonstrations - The Web Conference 2026</h1>
    
        <p>
          We invite demonstration contributions to <b>The Web Conference 2026 (formerly known as WWW)</b>. 
          The conference will take place in <b>Dubai, United Arab Emirates, from April 13 to 17, 2026</b>.
        </p>
    
        <p>
          The Web Conference is the premier conference focused on understanding the current state and the evolution of the Web 
          through the lens of different disciplines, including computing, computational social science, economics and political sciences.
        </p>
    
        <p>
          The Demo Track is a forum to foster interactions among researchers and practitioners by allowing them to demonstrate 
          their new and innovative work. In addition, the track will enable conference attendees to learn novel ongoing research 
          projects through informal interactions. Demo submissions must be based on an implemented and tested system. 
          We strongly encourage submissions describing innovative applications, with which the conference attendees can interact directly hands-on.
        </p>
    
        <p>
          Submitted demos are expected to be aligned with one or more of the relevant topics of The Web Conference community 
          (such as those covered by the 
          <a href="https://www2026.thewebconf.org/calls/research-tracks.html" target="_blank">research tracks</a>).

        <h2>Submission Guidelines and Requirements</h2>
        <p><b>Content.</b> Submissions should clearly detail the context, and contributions, of the demonstration that is being proposed. 
          It is essential to outline how the demonstration would be instantiated and deployed in a conference venue.</p>
    
        <h3>Formatting Requirements</h3>
        <p>
          Submissions must be written in English, in double-column format, and must adhere to the
