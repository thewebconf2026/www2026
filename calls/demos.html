        <h1>Call for Demonstrations - The Web Conference 2026</h1>

        <p>
          We invite demonstration contributions to
          <b>The Web Conference 2026 (formerly known as WWW)</b>. The conference
          will take place in
          <b>Dubai, United Arab Emirates, from April 13 to 17, 2026</b>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Web Conference is the premier conference focused on understanding
          the current state and the evolution of the Web through the lens of
          different disciplines, including computing, computational social
          science, economics and political sciences.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Demo Track is a forum to foster interactions among researchers and
          practitioners by allowing them to demonstrate their new and innovative
          work. In addition, the track will enable conference attendees to learn
          novel ongoing research projects through informal interactions. Demo
          submissions must be based on an implemented and tested system. We
          strongly encourage submissions describing innovative applications,
          with which the conference attendees can interact directly hands-on.
        </p>

        <p>
          Submitted demos are expected to be aligned with one or more of the
          relevant topics of The Web Conference community (such as those covered
          by the

        <h2>Submission Guidelines and Requirements</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Content.</b> Submissions should clearly detail the context, and
          contributions, of the demonstration that is being proposed. It is
          essential to outline how the demonstration would be instantiated and
          deployed in a conference venue.
        </p>

        <h3>Formatting Requirements</h3>
        <p>
          Submissions must be written in English, in double-column format, and
          must adhere to the
