        <h1>Call for Workshops - The Web Conference 2026</h1>

        <p>
          We invite proposals for workshops to be held at The Web Conference 2026 (formerly known as
          WWW). The conference will take place in <strong>Dubai, UAE, from 13 April to 17 April 2026</strong>, and
          Workshops will take place over the first two days of the conference, from <strong>13 April to 14 April
          2026</strong>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The Web Conference 2026 will feature a number of co-located workshops that are intended to
          provide a forum for researchers and practitioners in Web technologies to discuss and exchange
          positions on current and emergent Web topics. Workshop participants will be given the
          opportunity to exchange ideas, learn cutting-edge science and technological advancements for
          the Web, establish common ground in research areas or applied problems, and identify new
          opportunities for collaboration and new directions for future work.
        </p>

        <p>
          In addition to the traditional mini-conference format, we encourage innovative and interactive
          workshop designs that promote engagement and creativity. Examples include, but are not
          limited to:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Speed-dating workshops</strong> – brief, timed conversations between pairs of participants to share and discuss research ideas or findings.</li>
          <li><strong>Brainstorming and discussion-based formats</strong> – highly interactive sessions aimed at generating creative solutions, exchanging diverse perspectives, and exploring emerging challenges.</li>
          <li><strong>Reading group sessions</strong> – focused discussions on seminal or influential papers, with the goal of deepening understanding, critiquing methodologies, and examining broader impacts.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          We welcome proposals that experiment with novel structures and participation formats to
          maximize interaction and innovation.
        </p>

        </p>

        <h3>Structure.</h3>
        <p>Workshop proposals should conform the following structure:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A concise title</li>
          <li>The names, affiliations, and contact information of ALL organizers, as well as the individuals planning to attend in person.</li>
          <li>Proposed duration of the workshop - half or full day</li>
          <li>A statement of the workshop objectives</li>
          <li>A brief description (draft outline) of the proposed workshop format, discussing the mix of events and activities such as paper presentations, invited talks, panels, hacking sessions, breakout sessions, or general discussion slots, and an approximate timeline (please be sure to allocate enough time for interaction between participants, not just for invited talks)</li>
          <li>A two-paragraph description of the workshop topics and themes, discussing why this topic is relevant at this time</li>
          <li>Explanation of why the proposed workshop is a good match for The Web Conference 2026</li>

          <li>A short bio of the workshop organizers, including a description of their relevant qualifications and past experience in organizing workshops or research meetings</li>
          <li>Poster session (if you plan a poster session, it is necessary to indicate the number of poster boards required)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Reviewing Process</h2>
        <p>
          The decision about acceptance or rejection of workshop proposals will be made by a small
          program committee, the Workshop Chairs and in consultation with the General Chairs, taking
          into account several factors including overall quality, the topic fit with respect to The Web
          Conference 2026, the coverage of the topic in other tracks of the conference, the estimated
          number of attendees for the workshop, a clear focus, and the venue capacity. Moreover, special
          attention will be given to inclusion and diversity balance in the workshop PC composition and
          the list of invited speakers. We also favour workshops that are genuine interactive events
          (allocated time for panel discussion etc.) and not mini-conferences. Workshops with creative
          structures and organizations that attract various types of contributions and ensure rich
          interactions are welcomed.
        </p>

        <h2>Publication and Registration Policies</h2>

        <p>
          <b>Publication.</b> Each accepted workshop will have a summary included in the Companion
          Proceedings of the Web Conference 2026.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Registration.</b> At least one organizer commits to register and attend in person.
        </p>

        <h2>Organizational Details for Workshops</h2>
        <p>
          The organizers of accepted workshops will be responsible for their own review process and
          publicity. They must maintain an up-to-date website for their workshop that will be referenced
          from The Web Conference 2026 website. They are required to finalize all details and to provide
          input for publicity. Accepted workshops will be scheduled so as to avoid conflicts with
          conference sessions in similar or related areas.
        </p>

        <p>
          Workshop organizers must inform the Workshop Chairs of the numbers of submissions and
          acceptances as these numbers become available. Workshops with fewer than 15 expected
          registrants may be merged with other workshops at the discretion of the conference organizers.
        </p>

        <p>
          The workshop organization shall follow the same guidelines as the main conference in terms of
          physical presence. The workshops are an in-person event. Authors of workshop papers should
          attend the Web Conference 2026 in person. We also expect that the invited talks will be
          delivered physically in the venue (in-person attendance). In exceptional circumstances, we will
          allow each workshop for up to 25% virtual talks (the organizers must handle which speakers are
          in-person, and who is exempt to present virtually).
        </p>

        <p>
          Papers accepted by a workshop can be included in the Companion Proceedings of the Web
          Conference 2026, subject to meeting the camera-ready timeline. Workshop papers that have
          been previously published or are under review for another journal, conference or workshop
          should not be considered for publication.
        </p>
