        <h1>Call for Industry Tracks - The Web Conference 2026</h1>

        <p>
          We invite contributions to the Industry Track of The Web Conference
          2026 (formerly known as WWW). The conference will take place in
          <b>Dubai, UAE, from April 13 to 17, 2026</b>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Web Conference is the premier conference focused on understanding
          the current state and the evolution of the Web through the lens of
          different disciplines, including computing, computational social
          science, economics, and political sciences.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Industry Track welcomes contributions showcasing original results
          obtained in an industrial environment, having clear industry
          relevance, and highlighting new research challenges motivated by
          practical tasks and practical settings. The Industry Track is distinct
          from the Research Track in that
          <b>submissions focus on applied work</b> describing, for
          example, an implementation of a system, acquisition of data, or
          application of a methodology, that solves a significant real-world
          problem and demonstrates benefits as well as impact. Submissions must
          <b
            >clearly describe how their work has been deployed or
            released</b
          >, and for how long.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b
            >This year, the Industry Track has been "elevated" to have equal
            standing with the Research Tracks. Consequently, the Industry Track
            papers will be part of the Main proceedings of The ACM Web
            Conference 2026, alongside the Research Tracks papers.</b

            to manage the submissions and reviewing. Submissions will not be
            made public on OpenReview during the reviewing period.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b
              >All listed authors must have an up-to-date OpenReview

          <ul>
            <li>
              <b
                >New profiles created without an institutional email</b
              >
              will go through a moderation process that
              <b>can take up to two weeks</b>. Therefore, please start
              the process of creating a profile / account at OpenReview well
              ahead of time - requests to extend the submission deadline because
              you could not create an OpenReview account will be denied.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>New profiles created with an institutional email</b>
              will be activated automatically (but you still should not wait to
              do so until the last minute :)
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Your OpenReview profile will be used to handle conflicts of interest
            and paper matching to reviewers. To be considered complete, each
            author profile must be properly attributed with the following
            mandatory fields: current and past institutional affiliation (going
            back at least 5 years), homepage, DBLP, ORCID, and Recent
            Publications. In addition, other fields such as Google Scholar,
            LinkedIn, Semantic Scholar, Advisors, Advisees and Other Relations
            should be indicated wherever applicable.
          </p>

          <p>
            Abstracts and papers can be submitted through

          </p> -->

          <h2>Scope</h2>
          <p>
            We welcome high-quality submissions that highlight novel
            applications, architectures, deployments, and insights derived from
            operational data, as well as engineering breakthroughs that push the
            boundaries of what is possible on the Web at scale.
          </p>

          <p>
            Industry papers should emphasize practical relevance, system design
            trade-offs, real-world constraints, or lessons learned from
            large-scale deployments. Submissions may focus on new technologies,
            product experiences, tools, or services that address concrete
            problems faced in practice. We especially encourage papers that
            demonstrate measurable impact in industrial settings or those that
            bridge the gap between theory and application.
          </p>

          <p>
            Papers will be reviewed with an emphasis on clarity, originality,
            significance of insights, and relevance to the broader Web
            community, with a focus on real-world applicability over theoretical
            novelty.

          <b>Deadlines.</b>
          <p>
            <b
              >The submission deadlines are strict and no extensions</b
            >, regardless of circumstances, will be allowed.
            <b>Placeholder/dummy abstracts are forbidden</b>.
          </p>

          <b>Authorship</b>
          <p>
            The ACM has a
            <a
              href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/authorship"
              target="_blank"
              >policy</a
            >
            stating who can be considered an author in a submission. Every
            person named as the author of a paper must have contributed
            substantially to the work described in the paper and/or to the
            writing of the paper and must take responsibility for the entire
            content of a paper.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Non-anonymity.</b> Submissions are not anonymous,
              hence authors should list their names and affiliations.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Maximum authorship.</b> The number of submissions
              allowed per author to the Industry track is limited to
              <b>5 (five)</b> maximum. If more than 5 papers are
              submitted with the same person listed as an author, the additional
              papers submitted after the first 5 by submission id, will be
              desk-rejected.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Authorship changes.</b> The full list of authors,
              including the ordering, must be finalized at the point of
              submission. There cannot be any addition, removal, or reordering
              of authors after submission time. The only changes allowed are the
              correction of spelling mistakes or new affiliation.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Formatting Requirements</h3>
          <p>
            Submissions must be written in English, in double-column format, and
            must adhere to the
            <a
              href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template"
              target="_blank"
              >ACM template and format</a
            >
            (also
            <a
              href="https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/acm-conference-proceedings-primary-article-template/wbvnghjbzwpc"
              target="_blank"
              >available in Overleaf</a

              target="_blank"
              >Word Interim Template</a
            >. The recommended setting for LaTeX is:
          </p>

          <code>\documentclass[sigconf, review]{acmart}</code>

          <p>
            Submissions must be a single PDF file: up to
            <b>8 (eight) pages</b> as the main paper, followed by
            references and an optional Appendix (that can contain details on
            reproducibility, proofs, pseudo-code, etc), for a maximum total PDF
            length of <b>12 (twelve) pages</b>.
            <b
              >The first 8 pages should be self-contained, since reviewers are
              not required to read past that</b
            >.
          </p>

          <h3>Originality and Concurrent Submissions</h3>
          <p>
            Submissions must present <b>original work</b>—this means
            that papers under review at or published/accepted to any
            peer-reviewed conference/journal with published proceedings cannot
            be submitted. Submissions that have been previously presented
            orally, as posters or abstracts-only, or in non-archival venues with
            no formal proceedings, including workshops without proceedings, are
            allowed. Authors may submit work that is already available as a
            preprint (e.g., on arXiv or SSRN). The ACM has a
            <b>strict</b>
            <a
              href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism"
              target="_blank"
              >policy against plagiarism, misrepresentation, and
              falsification</a
            >
            that applies to all publications.
          </p>

          <h3>Serving as Reviewer</h3>
          <p>
            To ensure that all papers receive a sufficient number of high
            quality reviewers, every submission must nominate at least one
            author who is a <b>qualified reviewer</b> (i.e., authors
            with at least three papers in The Web Conference or other related
            conferences). Being nominated as a reviewer in the submission
            constitutes an acceptance and a commitment to carry out the regular
            reviewing load responsibly. Only if
            <b>no qualified reviewer exists</b> in the author list,
            nominate the best-qualified author for consideration by the PC
            chairs.
            <b
              >Failure to provide a qualified reviewer when one exists in the
              author list, or failure to carry out the assigned reviewing duty
              properly, will constitute sufficient grounds for desk
              rejection</b
            >. Note that authors with three or more submissions will be
            automatically included as a reviewer, even if not explicitly
            nominated by any submission, and will be expected to carry a full
            reviewing load.
          </p>

          <h3>LLM Policy for Authoring</h3>
          <p>
            <b>Authorship means accountability for the work</b>. As
            such,
            <b
              >Large Language Models (LLMs) (e.g., ChatGPT) cannot be considered
              authors</b
            >. Any use of LLM in the writing, programming, experimenting, etc.,
            must be properly documented and declared in the submission form and
            described in an appendix (except for using AI for spell-checking and
            grammar-checking only).
            <b
              >Any and all authors are fully accountable for the entire text in
              the paper</b
            >.
          </p>

          <h3>Ethical Use of Data and Informed Consent</h3>
          <p>
            Authors are encouraged to include a section on the ethical use of
            data and/or informed consent of research subjects in their paper,
            when appropriate. You and your co-authors are subject to all
            <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies" target="_blank"
              >ACM Publications Policies</a
            >, including

              target="_blank"
              >ACM's Publications Policy on Research Involving Human
              Participants and Subjects</a
            >
            (posted in 2021). Please ensure all authors are familiar with these
            policies.
          </p>

          <p>
            Please consult the regulations of your institution(s) indicating
            when a review by an Institutional Ethics Review Board (IRB) is
            needed. Note that submitting your research for approval by such may
            not always be sufficient. Even if such research has been approved by
            your IRB, the program committee might raise additional concerns
            about the ethical implications of the work and include these
            concerns in its review.

          <h2>Reviewing Process</h2>

          <h3>Reviewing</h3>
          <p>
            Submissions will be peer-reviewed by members of the Industry Track
            Program Committee based on originality, significance, quality, and
            clarity. Each submission will receive
            <b>at least three independent reviews</b>, overseen by an
            Area Chair (AC). The review process will be
            <b>single-blind</b>, i.e., the identity of authors will be
            visible to reviewers and ACs.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b
              >At least one author per submission must commit to be a reviewer,
              carry the regular load, and submit all their reviews on
              time</b
            >. If any author of a submission does not carry out the reviewing
            task in a proper and timely manner, no author of that submission
            will see the reviews of that submission during the rebuttal stage.
          </p>

          <h3>Non-LLM Policy for Reviewing</h3>
          <p>
            Reviewers must commit that they will
            <b
              >not be relying on Large Language Models (LLMs) during
              reviewing</b
            >.
            <b
              >Any sort of uploading of paper content to any LLM is expressly
              prohibited</b
            >. Reviewers cannot share the paper content with anyone else or with
            LLMs.
          </p>

          <h3>Rebuttal</h3>
          <p>
            Authors will have the chance to provide one length-limited response
            to each review during the rebuttal period. The rebuttal to any
            review will be visible to all reviewers. Reviewers will be prompted
            to acknowledge author rebuttals and revise their review if
            necessary. The ACs will consider the authors' response to the points
            raised by the reviewers, as well as discussion among reviewers, to
            inform acceptance decisions.
          </p>

          <h3>Withdrawal</h3>
          <p>
            Authors may use the withdrawal button on OpenReview up until the
            rebuttal deadline. Beyond that, any request to withdraw must be made
            to the Industry Track Chairs in writing, and approval for late
            withdrawal is at the discretion of the Industry Track Chairs.
          </p>

          <h3>Decision</h3>
          <p>
            A range of factors including technical merit, originality, potential
            impact, quality of execution, quality of presentation, related work,
            reproducibility of results, and ethics, will be used by the ACs to
            make a recommendation. The Industry Track Chairs will make the final
            decisions.
          </p>

          <h3>Transparency</h3>
          <p>
            By submitting paper(s), the authors agree that the original
            submission, reviews, meta-reviews, and discussions will be made
            public in OpenReview for only the accepted papers.
          </p>

          <h2>Publication and Presentation Policies</h2>

          <h3>Publication</h3>
          <p>
            Each accepted paper will be included in the
            <b>Main Proceedings of The ACM Web Conference 2026</b>. In
            addition, each paper has the opportunity to submit a brief
            pre-recorded video, which will appear on ACM Digital Library, along
            with the PDF.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>AUTHORS TAKE NOTE:</b> The official publication date is
            the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital
            Library.
            <b
              >This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the
              conference</b
            >. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent
            filings related to published work.
          </p>

          <h3>Registration</h3>
          <p>
            To be included in the proceedings, every accepted paper must be
            covered by a <b>distinct</b> conference registration,
            e.g., two papers require two registrations, even if they have
            overlapping authors. This registration must be
            <b>Full Conference (5-day) or Main Conference (3-day)</b>
            registration, at the
            <b>standard (non-student) in-person rate</b>, payment of
            which must be completed by the camera-ready deadline. This
            registration requirement applies universally, regardless of
            attendance or presentation mode.
          </p>

          <h3>Presentation</h3>
          <p>
            <b
              >Every accepted paper must be presented in-person at the
              conference</b
            >.
            <b>No-show papers may be withdrawn from the proceedings</b
            >. There will be two forms of presentation:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Oral Presentation.</b> The Industry Track Program
              Committee will select a subset of the accepted papers for oral
              presentation.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Poster Presentation.</b> All papers will be asked to
              present a poster on-site.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Reproducibility</h3>
          <p>
            Authors are bly encouraged to make their code and data publicly
            available after the review process. We are encouraging the
            (optional) use of the "Artifacts Available" badge in ACM's Digital
            Library. If you release any code, dataset, or similar artifact to
            accompany your paper, and host it in a publicly available, archival
            repository for research artifacts that provides a Document Object
            Identifier (DOI), you are welcome to apply for this badge. A special
            subcommittee will check the artifacts of all accepted papers for
            availability and relatedness to the paper after the acceptance
            notification.
          </p>
