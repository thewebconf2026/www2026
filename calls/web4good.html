        <h1>Call for Papers - Special Track on Web4Good</h1>

        <p>
          We invite contributions to the Special Track on Web4Good of the ACM Web Conference 2026.
          The conference will take place in <strong>Dubai, United Arab Emirates, from April 13 to 17, 2026</strong>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Today's web and social media solutions often fail to address critical societal challenges related
          to environmental sustainability, climate action, and vulnerable populations. The recent rise of
          large language models (LLMs) and other GenAI applications introduces new risks, as their
          computationally and energy-intensive training amplifies environmental impacts. Furthermore,
          these systems are frequently trained on biased and uncontrolled datasets, posing significant
          risks to vulnerable communities. This trend extends to GenAI agents and web agents, which
          present both opportunities for positive change and new challenges, such as the potential for
          misuse in spreading misinformation or automating bias at a massive scale.
        </p>

        <p>
          In this context, we invite papers that research, design, develop, or apply web and social media
          technologies to address these issues. We are particularly interested in contributions that focus
          on fostering sustainable development, building healthy human societies, and supporting
          vulnerable or marginalized communities.
        </p>

        <p>
          The goal of this track is to bring together researchers and developers from academia, industry,
          and civil society to present and debate methods for creating a web that is truly for the good of
          all. We seek to achieve a web that is inclusive, non-discriminative, sustainable, ethical, and
          open. Contributions should detail research results, tools, design techniques, and experiments
          that are being developed to deal with these topics. We are especially interested in how web
          technologies can contribute to the UN Sustainable Development Goals, and how GenAI agents
          and web agents can be leveraged for humanitarian response, disaster recovery, and wildlife
          protection. We also welcome submissions that explore how to develop new partnerships, such
          as Data Collaboratives, to unlock data and data science capabilities for these societal
          challenges.

        <h2>Special Theme: Energy-Aware Web and AI Systems for Sustainability</h2>
        <p>
          The 2026 edition of Web4Good introduces a special focus on Energy-Aware Web and AI
          Systems for Sustainability. As the web and AI ecosystems grow in scale, their environmental
          footprint, driven by data centers, large model training, and pervasive digital services, poses
          urgent challenges for sustainable development. This theme invites research on designing
          energy-efficient algorithms, architectures, and infrastructures that minimize carbon impact while
          maintaining accessibility, fairness, and inclusivity. We seek contributions that explore novel
          methods to monitor, optimize, and reduce energy use across the web and AI lifecycle, from
          responsible model training to sustainable deployment of GenAI agents and web platforms.

        </p>

        <h2>Submission Guidelines</h2>
        
        <p>
          <b>Authorship.</b> The ACM has an
          <a
            href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship"
            target="_blank"
            >authorship policy</a
          >
          stating who can be considered an author in a submission as well as the
          use of generative AI tools. Every person named as the author of a
          paper must have contributed substantially to the work described in the
          paper and/or to the writing of the paper and must take responsibility
          for the entire content of the paper.
        </p>

        <!-- <p>
          <b>Maximum authorship.</b> The number of submissions allowed per
          author is limited to 9 (nine) maximum. If more than 9 papers are submitted with the same
          person listed as an author, the additional papers submitted after the
          first 9 by submission id, will be desk-rejected. (Note that this is a total submission across all tracks, including the main track)
        </p> -->

        <p>
          <b>Authorship changes.</b> The full list of authors, including the
          ordering, must be finalized at the point of submission. There cannot
          be any addition, removal, or reordering of authors after submission time. The only changes allowed are the correction of
          spelling mistakes or a new affiliation.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Formatting Requirements.</b> Submissions must be written in English, in
          double-column format, and must adhere to the
          <a href="#">ACM template and format</a> (also
          <a href="#">available</a> in Overleaf). Word users may use the Word
          Interim Template. The recommended setting for LaTeX is:
        </p>
        <p><code>\documentclass[sigconf, review]{acmart}.</code></p>
        
        <p>
          For the special tracks, submissions are limited to 8 content pages, which should include all
          figures and tables, but excluding supplementary material and references. In addition, you can
          include 2 additional pages of supplementary material. The total number of pages with
          supplementary material and references must not exceed 12 pages.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Anonymity.</b> The review process will be double-blind. The
          submitted document should omit any author names, affiliations, or
          other identifying information. This may include, but is not restricted
          to acknowledgments, self-citations, references to prior work by the
          author(s), and so on. Please use the third-person to identify your own
          prior work. You may explicitly refer in the paper to organizations
          that provided datasets, hosted experiments, or deployed solutions and
          tools.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Originality and Concurrent Submissions.</b> Submissions must
          present original work—this means that papers under review at or
          published/accepted to any peer-reviewed conference/journal with
          published proceedings cannot be submitted. Submissions that have been
          previously presented orally, as posters or abstracts-only, or in
          non-archival venues with no formal proceedings, including workshops or
          PhD symposia without proceedings, are allowed. Authors may submit
          anonymized work that is already available as a preprint (e.g., on
          arXiv or SSRN) without citing it. The ACM has a strict

        <p>
          Submissions that do not follow these guidelines or do not view or
          print properly, will be desk-rejected.
        </p>

        <h2>Publication and Presentation Policies</h2>

        <p>
          <b>Publication.</b> Each accepted paper will be included in the Proceedings of the Web Conference
          2026. In addition, each paper is required to submit a brief pre-recorded video, which will appear
          on ACM Digital Library, along with the PDF.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Registration.</b> To be included in the proceedings, every accepted
