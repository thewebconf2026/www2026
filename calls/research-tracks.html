        </p>

        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p>
          The scope of the conference is the Web and how it has crucially
          enabled new research and applications. While the Web feeds on and is
          part of a broader interdisciplinary ecosystem, including technologies
          such as machine learning, natural language processing, computer
          vision, and many others, it remains a distinct scholarly field, with
          its own research methods, tools, and challenges. A typical Web
          Conference paper should have an explicit focus on at least one of the
          following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            understanding, evaluating, and improving the Web as a technical
            infrastructure; including core Web technologies, standards, and
            platforms
          </li>
          <li>
            understanding, evaluating, and improving the Web as a socio-economic
            system;
          </li>
          <li>
            understanding better the impact of the Web and Web technologies;
          </li>
          <li>
            democratizing access to Web content and technologies, making it more
            accessible, fair, inclusive, and accountable to a wide range of
            audiences
          </li>
        </ul>
      </br>
        <h2>Relevance</h2>
        <p>
          Every submission must clearly state how the work is relevant to the
          Web and to the track in the first page. Submissions that merely use a
          Web artifact---e.g., a dataset or a Web Application Programmer
          Interface (API) or a social network---rather than answering a specific
          Web-related scientific research challenge, are out of scope and will
          be desk-rejected.
        </p>

        <h2>Tracks</h2>

          paper must have contributed substantially to the work described in the
          paper and/or to the writing of the paper and must take responsibility
          for the entire content of a paper.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Maximum authorship.</b> The number of submissions allowed per
          author is limited to 7 (seven) maximum, cumulatively across the
          research tracks. If more than 7 papers are submitted with the same
          person listed as an author, the additional papers submitted after the
          first 7 by submission ID, will be desk-rejected after the full paper
          submission deadline.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Authorship changes.</b> The full list of authors, including the
          ordering, must be finalized at the point of submission. There cannot
          be any addition, removal, or reordering of authors after the abstract
          submission deadline. The only changes allowed are the correction of
          spelling mistakes or new affiliations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Authorship means accountability for the work. As such, Large Language
          Models (LLMs) (e.g., ChatGPT) cannot be considered authors. You can
          use LLMs to rephrase your text, but you are solely responsible for the
          text in the paper.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Anonymity.</b> The review process will be double-blind. The
          submitted document should omit any author names, affiliations, or
          other identifying information. This may include, but is not restricted
          to acknowledgments, self-citations, references to prior work by the
          author(s), and so on. Please use the third-person to identify your own
          prior work. You may explicitly refer in the paper to organizations
          that provided datasets, hosted experiments, or deployed solutions and
          tools.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Formatting Requirements.</b> Submissions must be in English, in
          double-column format, and must adhere to the
          <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">ACM template and format</a> (also
          <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/association-for-computing-machinery-acm-sig-proceedings-template/bmvfhcdnxfty">available</a> in Overleaf). Word users may use the Word
          Interim Template and the recommended setting for LaTeX is:
        </p>
        <p><code>\documentclass[sigconf, anonymous, review]{acmart}.</code></p>
        <p>
          Submissions must be a single PDF file: 8 (eight) pages as main paper,
          with additional pages for references and an optional Appendix (that
          might contain details on reproducibility, proofs, pseudo-code, etc),
          up to a maximum of 12 (twelve) pages in total. The first 8 pages
          should be self-contained, since reviewers are not required to read
          past that.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Originality and Concurrent Submissions.</b> Submissions must
          present original work---this means that papers under review at or
          published/accepted to any peer-reviewed conference / journal with
          published proceedings cannot be submitted. Submissions that have been
          previously presented orally, as posters or abstracts-only, or in
          non-archival venues with no formal proceedings, including workshops or
          PhD symposia without proceedings, are allowed. Authors may submit
          anonymized work that is already available as a preprint (e.g., on
          arXiv or SSRN) without citing it. The ACM has a strict
          <a
            href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism-overview"
            target="_blank"
          >
            against plagiarism, misrepresentation, and falsification</a
          >
          that applies to all publications.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Ethical Use of Data and Informed Consent.</b> Authors are
          encouraged to include a section on the ethical use of data and/or
          informed consent of research subjects in their paper, when
          appropriate. You and your co-authors are subject to all
          <a

          </a>
          on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects (posted in
          2021). Please ensure all authors are familiar with these policies.
        </p>

        <p>
          Please consult the regulations of your institution(s) indicating when
          a review by an Institutional Ethics Review Board (IRB) is needed. If
          your work has been reviewed by an IRB, please indicate this in the
          paper, providing approval numbers where appropriate. Failure to comply
          with the above-mentioned policy on Human Participants and Subjects
          will lead to a rejection of the paper.
        </p>
        <p>
          Submissions that do not follow these guidelines or do not view or
          print properly, will be desk-rejected.
        </p>

        <h2>Reviewing Process</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Reviewing.</b> Each paper is submitted to one of the tracks listed
          above. Papers that do not conform to the conference scope or
          submission guidelines will be desk-rejected by the track chairs.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Rebuttal.</b> Authors will have the chance to provide a response to
          the reviews during a rebuttal period. After the end of the rebuttal
          period, reviewers, together with senior PC members and track chairs,
          will consider the authors' responses to inform acceptance decisions.
          There will be no interactive rebuttal between authors and reviewers.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Decision.</b> A range of factors including technical merit,
          originality, potential impact, quality of execution, quality of
          presentation, related work, reproducibility of results, and ethics,
          will be used by the ACs and SACs to make a recommendation. The PC
          Chairs will make the final decisions.
        </p>
        <!-- <p>
          <b>Transparency.</b> By submitting paper(s) to The Web Conference
          2025, the authors agree that the reviews, meta-reviews, and
          discussions will be made public in OpenReview for all accepted papers.
        </p> -->

        <h2>Conflict of Interest (COI) Policy</h2>
        <p>
          All authors and reviewers must declare conflicts of interest in
          EasyChair. You must declare a domain conflict for employment at the
          same institution or company, regardless of geography/location,
          currently or in the last 12 months. You must declare a personal
          conflict when the following associations exist:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>candidate for employment at the same institution or company</li>
          <li>
            co-author on book/paper or co-PI on a funded grant/research proposal
            in the last 24 months
          </li>
          <li>active collaborator</li>
          <li>family relationship or close personal relationship</li>
          <li>
            graduate advisee/advisor relationship, regardless of time elapsed
            since graduation
          </li>
          <li>deep personal animosity</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In general, we expect authors, PC, the organizing committee, and other
          volunteers to adhere to
          <a
            href="https://www.acm.org/special-interest-groups/volunteer-resources/acm-conflict-of-interest-policy"
            target="_blank"

          >
        </p>


        <h2>Publication and Presentation Policies</h2>

        <p>
          <b>Publication.</b> All accepted papers will be allowed the same
          maximum page length in the proceedings (12 pages, of which 8 are
          content pages), which will be published by ACM and will be accessible
          via the ACM Digital Library. Accepted papers will require a further
          revision to meet the requirements of the camera-ready format required
          by ACM. Camera-ready versions of accepted papers can and should
          include all information to identify authors, and should acknowledge
          any funding received that directly supported the presented research.
          In addition, all papers are required to submit a brief pre-recorded
          video, which will appear on ACM Digital Library, along with the PDF of
          the papers.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Registration.</b> To be included in the proceedings, every accepted
          paper must be covered by a distinct conference registration, e.g., two
          papers require two registrations, even if they have overlapping
          authors. This registration must be Full Conference (5-day) or Main
          Conference (3-day) registration, at the standard (non-student)
          in-person rate, payment of which must be completed by the camera-ready
          deadline. This registration requirement applies universally,
          regardless of attendance or presentation mode.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Presentation.</b> Every accepted paper must be presented at the
          conference. No-show papers may be withdrawn from the proceedings.
          There will be two forms of presentation:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Oral Presentation.</b> Among the accepted papers, a subset will
            be selected for oral presentation. Generally we expect oral
            presentations to be in-person, but may allow a few online
            presentations by authors with significant travel difficulties.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Poster Presentation.</b> All papers will be asked to produce a
            poster on-site. An e-copy will appear on Whova.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <b>Reproducibility.</b> Authors are strongly encouraged to make their
          code and data publicly available after the review process. We are
          encouraging the (optional) use of the "Artifacts Available" badge in
          ACM's Digital Library. If you release any code, dataset, or similar
          artifact to accompany your paper, and host it in a publicly available,
          archival repository for research artifacts that provides a Document
          Object Identifier (DOI), you are welcome to apply for this badge. A
          special subcommittee will check the artifacts of all accepted papers
          for availability and relatedness to the paper after the acceptance
          notification.
        </p>

        <h3>Important update on ACM's new open access publishing model for 2026 ACM Conferences!</h3>

        <p>Starting January 1, 2026, ACM will fully transition to Open Access. All ACM publications, including those from ACM-sponsored conferences, will be 100% Open Access. Authors will have two primary options for publishing Open Access articles with ACM: the 
        ACM Open institutional model or by paying 
        Article Processing Charges (APCs).
        With over <a href="https://libraries.acm.org/acmopen/open-participants">2,700+ institutions</a> already part of ACM Open with more institutions joining from around the world every week, the majority of ACM-sponsored conference papers will not require APCs from authors or conferences (currently, around 75% on average across all ACM-sponsored conferences).</p>
        
        <p>Authors from institutions not participating in ACM Open will need to pay an APC to publish their papers, unless they qualify for a geographic or discretionary financial hardship waiver. 
        To find out whether an APC applies to your article, please consult the 
        <a href="https://libraries.acm.org/acmopen/open-participants">list of participating institutions</a> in ACM Open and review the 
        <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/policy-on-geographic-apc-waivers-and-discounts">Policy on Geographic APC Waivers and Discounts Policy</a> and the 
        <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/policy-on-discretionary-open-access-apc-waivers">Policy on Discretionary APC Waivers</a>. 
        Keep in mind that discretionary waivers are rare and are granted based on specific criteria set by ACM. Simply sending a message to ACM indicating an inability to pay an APC is typically insufficient justification for such a waiver. Waivers are based on the specific circumstances of the author(s) requesting the waiver. ACM does take seriously into consideration the institutional affiliation of the authors and whether it is a reasonable expectation that their institution should be joining the ACM Open program. This is necessary for the long-term financial sustainability of the ACM Open model.</p>
        
        <p>Understanding that this change could present financial challenges, ACM has approved a temporary subsidy for 2026 to ease the transition and allow more time for institutions to join ACM Open. The subsidy will offer:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>$250 APC for ACM/SIG members</li>
          <li>$350 for non-members</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>This represents a 65% discount off the regular <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/openaccess#oapricing">APC list prices</a>, funded directly by ACM. Authors are encouraged to help advocate for their institutions to join ACM Open during this transition period. This temporary subsidized pricing will apply to all conferences scheduled for 2026.</p>
