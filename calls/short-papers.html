        <h1>Call for Short Papers - The Web Conference 2026</h1>

        <p>
          We invite short paper contributions to The Web Conference 2026
          (formerly known as WWW). The Web Conference is the premier conference
          focused on understanding the current state and the evolution of the
          Web through the lens of different disciplines, including computing,
          computational social science, economics and political sciences.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Short Papers Track is a forum to foster interactions among
          researchers and practitioners by allowing them to present their new
          and innovative work. In addition, the track will enable conference
          attendees to learn novel ongoing research projects through informal
          interactions.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to research contributions, the conference welcomes
          high-quality resource papers that provide valuable datasets,
          benchmarks, or tools to the community.
        </p>
        <p>
          Submitted posters are expected to be aligned with one or more of the
          relevant topics of The Web Conference community (such as those covered
          by the research tracks).
        </p>

        <p>
          We encourage submissions to the short paper track as a way to foster
          broader engagement with the community and provide an opportunity for
          constructive feedback. We recommend that submissions demonstrate a
          clear and thoughtful foundation to maximize the benefit of the review
          process.

          <b>AUTHORS TAKE NOTE:</b> The official publication date is the date
          the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This
          date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference.
          The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent
          filings related to published work.

        <h2>Submission Guidelines</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Formatting Requirements.</b> Submissions must be written in
          English, in double-column format, and must adhere to the
          <a
            href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template"
            target="_blank"

          recommended setting for LaTeX is:
        </p>
        <pre>\documentclass[sigconf, review]{acmart}</pre>
        <p>
          Submission must be as a single PDF file: 4 (four) pages in length,
          including references.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Submission Site.</b> Submissions must be made through the
          <a

            target="_blank"

            EasyChair
          </a>
          system at (select the Short Papers track).
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Authorship.</b> Submissions are not anonymous, hence authors should
          list their names and affiliations.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Reviewing.</b> Submissions will be peer-reviewed by members of the
          Short Papers Program Committee based on originality, significance,
          quality, and clarity. The review process will be single-blind.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Ethical Use of Data and Informed Consent.</b> Authors are
          encouraged to include a section on the ethical use of data and/or
          informed consent of research subjects in their paper, when
          appropriate. You and your co-authors are subject to all

            target="_blank"

            target="_blank"

            ACM's Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants

          >
          (posted in 2021). Please ensure all authors are familiar with these
          policies.
        </p>

        <p>
          Please consult the regulations of your institution(s) indicating when
          a review by an Institutional Ethics Review Board (IRB) is needed. Note
          that submitting your research for approval by such may not always be
          sufficient. Even if such research has been approved by your IRB, the
          program committee might raise additional concerns about the ethical
          implications of the work and include these concerns in its review.
        </p>

        <h2>Authorship</h2>
        <p>
          The ACM has an
          <a
            href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship"
            target="_blank"
            >authorship policy</a
          >
          stating who can be considered an author in a submission as well as the
          use of generative AI tools. Every person named as the author of a
          paper must have contributed substantially to the work described in the
          paper and/or to the writing of the paper and must take responsibility
          for the entire content of a paper.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Maximum authorship.</b> The number of submissions allowed per
          author is limited to 7 (seven) maximum, cumulatively across the
          research tracks. If more than 7 papers are submitted with the same
          person listed as an author, the additional papers submitted after the
          first 7 by submission ID, will be desk-rejected after the full paper
          submission deadline.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Authorship changes.</b> The full list of authors, including the
          ordering, must be finalized at the point of submission. There cannot
          be any addition, removal, or reordering of authors after the abstract
          submission deadline. The only changes allowed are the correction of
          spelling mistakes or new affiliations.
        </p>

        <p>
          Authorship means accountability for the work. As such, Large Language
          Models (LLMs) (e.g., ChatGPT) cannot be considered authors. You can
          use LLMs to rephrase your text, but you are solely responsible for the
          text in the paper.
        </p>

        <h2>Publication and Presentation Policies</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Publication.</b> Each accepted paper will be included in the <b>Main
          Proceedings of the Web Conference 2026.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Registration.</b> To be included in the proceedings, every accepted
          paper must be covered by a distinct conference registration, e.g., two
          papers require two registrations, even if they have overlapping
          authors. This registration must be Full Conference (5-day) or Main
          Conference (3-day) registration, at the standard (non-student)
          in-person rate, payment of which must be completed by the camera-ready
          deadline. This registration requirement applies universally,
          regardless of attendance or presentation mode.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Presentation.</b> Every accepted paper must be presented at the
          conference as a poster. No-show papers may be withdrawn from the
          proceedings. All papers will be asked to produce a poster on-site.
        </p>
